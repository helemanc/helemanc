# 🎶 Hi there, I'm **Eleonora Mancini** 👋  
### PhD Candidate in Computer Science & Engineering 

I am a PhD candidate at the University of Bologna, working in the [Language Technologies Lab](https://site.unibo.it/nlp/en).  
My research focuses on **multimodal deep learning**, **language & speech & audio & music modeling**, and **explainability**, with the broader goal of understanding how AI interprets **human expressive signals** such as voice, language, and musical performance.

### 🧠 Research Interests
- **Multimodal AI for Human Expression** (speech × text × music)
- **Speech & paralinguistic signal modeling**
- **Multimodal Argument Mining & political discourse analysis**
- **AI for clinical assessment & decision support**
- **Music Information Retrieval & creative AI**
- **Explainable & perceptually-grounded model interpretation**

### 🔬 Research Experience
- **Visiting Researcher · Sony AI Barcelona**  
  Adapted large speech–language models to the music domain for **musical version identification** and **audio-based lyrics representation**.
  
- **Visiting Researcher · Mila / Québec AI Institute (SpeechBrain Lab)**  
  Benchmarked explainability techniques for speech-based **Parkinson’s and depression detection**, and developed **high-quality listenable explanations** grounded in human perception.

### 🎓 PhD Dissertation (in progress)
**_“Multimodal AI for Human Expression Understanding”_**  
Investigating how multimodal signals convey meaning across **political**, **clinical**, and **musical** communication settings.
